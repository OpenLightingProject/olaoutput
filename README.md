olaoutput is an object for Cycling 74's Max visual programming environment which enables the
transmission of data to OLA (Open Lighting Architecture), a service allowing transmission and
receiving of DMX information via a variety of hardware (Entec DMX USB Pro, uDMX, DMX King) and
IP protocols (Art-Net, sACN, ShowNet).

olaoutput currently works with Max 5 and 6 (32-bit and 64-bit) on OS X. OLA is required at development
and runtime. Cycling 74's Max SDK is required for development only.

See the https://wiki.openlighting.org/index.php/OlaOutput_Max_External for usage information.
