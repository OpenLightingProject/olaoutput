olaoutput is an object for Cycling 74's Max visual programming environment which enables the transmission of data to [OLA](http://opendmx.net/index.php/OLA) (Open Lighting Architecture), a service allowing transmission and receiving of DMX information via a variety of hardware (Entec DMX USB Pro, uDMX, DMX King) and IP protocols (Art-Net, sACN, ShowNet).

olaoutput currently works with Max 5 and 6 (32-bit and 64-bit) on OS X. OLA is required at development and runtime. Cycling 74's [Max SDK](http://cycling74.com/products/sdk/) is required for development only.

See the [OlaOutput page](http://opendmx.net/index.php/OlaOutput_Max_External) on the OpenDMX wiki for usage information.
